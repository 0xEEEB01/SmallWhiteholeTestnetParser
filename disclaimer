Take note that the script can't identify if the user
1) has supplied excessive amount of ETH...
2) ...made big profits by grabbing a ton of USDT -> GRV...
3) ...and then several days later repaid and withdrawn the ETH. The sum would still be 0.

I will see if I can improve the script, but cases like this can still be clearly seen on arbiscan

As a reference: good example of LEGIT zero-sum user:

This address is not on the potential cheaters output list.

And be aware that Whitehole Finance is a slow rug pull ehehehehe
